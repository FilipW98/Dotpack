Dotpack is a company specializing in optimizing logistics for businesses. This website was built on WordPress using Advanced Custom Fields (ACF). I developed this site based on a Figma mockup. It is one of many projects I worked on while employed at Happy Island. The website features: <br>
    - sliders implemented with Splide.js, <br>
    - a contact form created using the Contact Form 7 plugin, <br>
    - an interactive map powered by the Google Maps API, <br>
    - a blog page, <br>
    - posts with flexible sections that admins can add in any order.
